When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Question 1
a. Produce a scatter plot

```{r chunk 1}
sur$gender <- NULL
plot(sur)
```
* Remove gender variable because it is dummy variable. It is IV's and has no role to impact DV's.

b. Compute the correlation matrix
```{r chunk 2}
cor(sur)
```
c. Fit a model
- mathematical multiple regression model
$Y = \beta_0 + x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2+ x_3\beta_3 + x_4\beta_4+ x_5\beta_5 + \epsilon$ 

$Y = dependent variable - survival$

$beta_0 = intercept$

$x_1 = the first IV's - blood variable$

$x_2 = the  second IV's - prognosis variable$

$x_3 = the third IV's - enzyme variable$

$x_4 = the fourth IV's - liver variable$

$x_5 = the fifth IV's - age variable$

* the intercept is:

$b_0 = \bar{y} - \bar{x_1}b_1 - \bar{x_2}b_2 - ... - \bar{x_n}b_n$

* mathematical hypotheses for the overall ANOVA 

$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(\hat{Y_i} - \bar{Y})^2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(Y_i - \hat{Y})^2}$

```{r chunk 3}
sur.lm = lm(survival ~ blood + prognosis + enzyme + liver + age, data = sur)
anova(sur.lm)
```
 * Compute the F-test and P-value
```{r chunk 4}
sur.lm = lm(survival ~ blood + prognosis + enzyme + liver + age, data = sur)
summary(sur.lm)
```
$F-statistic = 21.87 $ on $5$ and $48 DF$

$p-value = 2.386e-11$

* State the null hypothesis:

$H_0 : \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 +...+\beta_k = 0$  

d. Find the best linear regression

* First check the line of plot to see which variable has high correlated

```{r chunk 5}
pairs(sur, panel = panel.smooth)
```

* Start with all predictors

```{r chunk 6}
sur.1 = lm(survival ~ . , data = sur)
summary(sur.1)
```

* After summary the data, we can see the liver with $p-value$ is larger than response, so it is insignificant variable so remove it.

```{r chunk 7}
sur.2 = lm(survival ~ blood + prognosis + enzyme + age, data = sur)
summary(sur.2)
```

* After removing the liver variable, we can see the age variable has same problem like liver, it shows up the $p-value$ larger than 0.05 then we need to remove it agains to get the best.

```{r chunk 8}
sur.3 = lm(survival ~ blood + prognosis + enzyme, data = sur)
summary(sur.3)
```

* Check diagnostics using plot

```{r chunk 9}
plot(sur.3, which = 1:2)
```

* Check residuals against predictors

```{r chunk 10}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(sur$blood, residuals(sur.3))
plot(sur$prognosis, residuals(sur.3))
plot(sur$enzyme, residuals(sur.3))
```

* Model interpretation - this part will help to find goodness of fit or the best fit linear

```{r chunk 11}
summary(sur.3)$coefficients
```

* For a unit increase in blood there is a 101.053 increase in survival time.

* For a unit increase in prognosis there is a 9.281 increase in survival time.

* For a unit increase in enzyme there is a 12.127 increase in survival time.

e. 

* It is not appropriate to use the multiple regression model because it has a negative intercept. This means that the expected value on your dependent variable will be less than 0 when all predictors variables are set to 0.

f. Re-fit the model using log(survival)

```{r chunk 12}
pairs(sur, panel = panel.smooth)
```

* Start with all predictors

```{r chunk 13}
sur.1 = lm(log(survival) ~ . , data = sur)
summary(sur.1)
```

* After summary the data, liver is insignificant variable so remove it.

```{r chunk 14}
sur.2 = lm(log(survival) ~ blood + prognosis + enzyme + age, data = sur)
summary(sur.2)
```

* After removing the liver variable, need to remove age variable to get the best.

```{r chunk 15}
sur.3 = lm(log(survival) ~ blood + prognosis + enzyme, data = sur)
summary(sur.3)
```

* Check diagnostics using plot

```{r chunk 16}
plot(sur.3, which = 1:2)
```

* Check residuals against predictors

```{r chunk 17}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(sur$blood, residuals(sur.3))
plot(sur$prognosis, residuals(sur.3))
plot(sur$enzyme, residuals(sur.3))
```

* Model interpretation - this part will help to find goodness of fit or the best fit.

```{r chunk 18}
summary(sur.3)$coefficients
```

g. Explain the function of log to find the linear

* Log is a con venient means of transforming a highly skewed variable into a more normalized dataset.

* When modeling variables having non-linear realationships, the risks of making mistakes are increased.

* By changing the distribution of the feature to a more normally-shaped bell curve, using the logarithm of one or more variable enhances the model's fit.

##Question 2:

a.

```{r chunk 19}
with(kml, table(driver, car))
```

* The design of the study is balanced. Because the replicates are available for all factors' pairs

b. Preliminary investigation

```{r chunk 20}
with(kml, interaction.plot(driver, car, kmL))
with(kml, interaction.plot(car, driver, kmL))
```

* Result: The lines are parallel, so there is no interaction between the two factors.

* Boxplot:

```{r chunk 21}
boxplot(kmL ~ driver + car, data = kml)
```

c. Group test

```{r chunk 22}
kml.int = lm(kmL ~ factor(car) * factor(driver), data = kml)
anova(kml.int)
```

* Fit reduced model without interaction (only main effects)

```{r chunk 23}
kml.reduced = update(kml.int, . ~ . - car:driver)
```

* ANOVA table for the model with interaction

```{r chunk 24}
anova(kml.int)
```

* Model $Y = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \gamma_ij + \epsilon$

  Hypotheses: $H0 : \gamma_ij = 0$, 
             H1 : at least one $\gamma_ij$ non-zero
             
  $P-Value = 0.3715 > 0.05$
  
* The interaction is not significant â‡’ fit reduced model with main effects only

* Fit model without interaction
```{r chunk 25}
anova(kml.reduced)
```

* Main Effects: Driver

  Model $Y = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon$
  
  Hypotheses: $H0 : \beta_j = 0$
  against H1 : at least one $\beta_j$ non-zero
  
  $P-Value = 2.2e-16 < 0.05$
  
  Driver is significant

* Main Effects: Car
  Model $Y = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon$

  Hypotheses: $H0 : \alpha_i = 0$
  against H1 : at least one $\alpha_i$ non-zero
  
  $P-Value = 2.2e-16 < 0.05$

* Car is significant

* Check Assumptions
```{r chunk 26}
plot(kml.reduced, which = 1:2)
```
* Normal QQ plot shows normality.

* The points is scattered randomly near the line.

d. Conclusion: 

* Because the result for model with interaction, p-value is insignificant, so the effect on the mean outcome of a change in factor Driver has no interaction of the level of factor Car.
